# optimized_cpp
Mary Montgomery's (@marymonty on github) Code from an Optimized C++ class that focused not only on code correctness, but on code optimization and speed as well.

Basics directory: contains smaller snippets of code for C++ "basics", showing my knowledge of topics including inheritance, templates, overloading, and pointers.

Homework directory: contains larger, more indepth coding assignments on topics including memory management, linked lists, and of course, pointers.
