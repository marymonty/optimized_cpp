Basics:

The code in this directory includes weekly assignments on "the basics" of C++. 
These basics include overloading, inheritance, pointers, debugging, STL, templates, and ellipsis.

Each directory has a readme with a summary description of the assignment, the actual assignment pdf, as well as my code. 

In most cases, my code is part of a more complex file structure that the professor created, so my code alone might not run as is, however, it is accurate and correct code that has been tested and verified.
