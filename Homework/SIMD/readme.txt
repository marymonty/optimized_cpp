SIMD

Single Instruction / Multiple Data
Implement SIMD using the Intel intrinsics guide (From MMX - SSE4.1 only). 
Combined repeated arithmetic operations into a single operation using the intrinsics.

What I did: I took the given files that implemented arithmetic based timed calculations (calculations like 4x4 matrix multiplications, vector multiplications, cross products, LERPs) and re-implemented those files and functions using SIMD and proxies in order to see possible speed improvements.
