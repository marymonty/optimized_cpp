FileList

This assignment was to write a load in place file using a contiguous memory footprint.
We had to take a doubly linked list of nodes, write them contiguously to a binary file,
then load that data from the binary file into one memory block, then fix the memory pointers
to recreate the doubly linked list. We were only allowed to use one call to "new".
