RVO / Proxies / Implicit Conversion

A three part homework assignment. 
RVO: return value optimization, I changed the original file to implement return value optimization in the functions.
Proxies: implemnting proxies for Vector addition (creating incremental structs to create an object that adds two vect's together, 
          then a struct for the two vect object added to a vect, then a struct for the three vect object added to a vect, etc)
Implicit Conversion: makes sure the Vect and set functions have accompanying templated versions so that there are no
                    paramters passed that would need to be converted
