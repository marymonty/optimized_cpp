Homework

This directory holds my homework assignments from the Optimized C++ class.
These were in depth assignments on topics ranging from linked lists, memory management, 
return value optimization, proxies, implicit conversion, SIMD, file systems, and pointers.

Each directory has a summarized description of the assignment in the readme, the actual assignment pdf, as well as my code.

In most cases, my code is part of a more complex file structure that the professor created, so my code alone might not run as is, however, it is accurate, correct, and optimized code that has been tested and verified.
