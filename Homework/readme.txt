Homework

This directory holds my homework assignments from the Optimized C++ class.
These were in depth assignments on topics ranging from linked lists, memory management, 
return value optimization, proxies, implicit conversion, SIMD, file systems, and pointers.

Each directory has my code and a description of the assignment.
