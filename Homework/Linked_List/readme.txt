Linked List

Homework meant to check our doubly linked list chops. 
This assignment is meant to simulate a Chicago Hot Dog Stand. 
There are three separate classes:
  HotDog
  Order
  Stand
The Stand class holds and manages a doubly linked list of Orders.
The Order class holds and manages a doubly linked list of HotDogs.
The HotDog class has 8-bit condiments and utilizes bitwise operators. 

We had to create and fill out these three classes and their associated functions.
